## How to Help
Anyone can help out by making a fork of this repo (top right of the screen) and then loading the project into Unreal Engine 5. You might need to go into Unreal Engine's tool bar / Tools / Refresh Visual Studio project if you are on Windows.

You can load the main test scene by going into Unreal Engine's Content Drawer / Maps / WorldMap
